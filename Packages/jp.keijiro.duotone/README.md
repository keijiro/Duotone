**Duotone** is a simple image stylization effect for Unity URP.

It provides the following two features:

- *Duotone posterization* - It reconstructs an input image with two colors
  (duotone). It also provides two extra peak colors (dark/highlight) and
  dithering options.
- *Contour lines* - It draws contour lines on object edges. To use this mode,
  you must use the Duotone Surface shader to embed normal/depth information
  into the color buffer.

## System requirements

## How to set up

First, you must add the Duotone Feature to the URP Renderer Features list.
Please check [the manual page] if you haven't used renderer features with URP.

Unlike the other renderer features, the Duotone Feature doesn't provide any
property. You can control the effect using the Duotone Controller component.
